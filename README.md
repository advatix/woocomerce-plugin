Installing the Plugin using the WordPress Admin Plugin Upload:-

Plugins that are not uploaded to the WordPress plugin directory should be uploaded using the upload method to install such plugins. I will show you how to install WordPress plugins using the upload option in the admin area.

First, you need to download the plugin from the source (which will be a zip file). Next, you need to go to WordPress admin area and visit "Plugins » Add New" page.

After that, click on the ‘Upload Plugin’ button on top of the page.
